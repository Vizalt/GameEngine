# **Core Sub-Systems**
### Editor Docking
ImGui's docking helped us to provide a cleaner workspace, allowing us to move the windows we created freely.
### Gameobject & Component System
The engine utilizes a Component system and Gameobjects. This allows us to create as many as desired and allows to adjust them to specific needs.
### Camera Culling
Camera Culling allows the scene to be rendered to give the program faster and more accurate rendering by not drawing meshes that are not on the screen.
### Particle System

### Camera Editor and Movement
Mist Engine includes a camera which can be controlled by the user, along with some parameters that allow customizing and moving the game's camera.
